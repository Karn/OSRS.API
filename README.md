# OSRS.me
An open dataset for OldSchool Runescape.

## Data sets
Currently the primary data set consists of extensive item data. This ranges from ID, name, and description to equipment data for weapons and armour.

The item dataset is available as raw JSON data [here](/data/items.json).

## API
The API is built with GraphQL which allows the data to be accessed on a need to know basis. Where you can request the required data and the resulting output will contain just that data. Ofcourse you can request all the data.

The API is available [here](http://osrs.me/api/).
